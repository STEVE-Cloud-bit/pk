            <h2>🌱 A Balanced Approach: Physical & Mental Activities in Avocado Farming (Section 3)</h2>
            <p>Avocado farming is more than just growing trees—it’s a <strong>combination of physical labor and strategic thinking</strong> that drives efficiency, sustainability, and profitability. Both <strong>farm and office activities</strong> play a crucial role in ensuring a smooth operation, from soil preparation to market strategy.</p>

            <h3>💪 Physical Activities: The Backbone of Avocado Farming</h3>

            <h4>🌿 Inside the Farm</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soil Preparation & Planting</strong> – Ensuring fertile soil and optimal seedling placement for strong tree growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Irrigation & Pest Control</strong> – Managing water distribution and protecting crops from diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Pruning & Harvesting</strong> – Enhancing productivity by maintaining healthy trees and collecting high-quality fruit.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting & Packing</strong> – Ensuring avocados meet market standards before distribution.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>🏢 Inside the Office</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Warehouse Handling</strong> – Organizing inventory, packaging, and shipping orders efficiently.</li>
                <li><strong>Customer & Supplier Engagement</strong> – Managing transactions, coordinating deliveries, and handling inquiries.</li>
            </ul>
